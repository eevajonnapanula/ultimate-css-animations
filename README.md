# Ultimate Frisbee Animations

This is a little project for learning some CSS-animations. As I play
ultimate frisbee, and we often use drawings to demonstrate tactics, I
wanted to try out if I could produce some plays with pure CSS.
Obviously, I couldn't use our teams plays, so I had to use Google to
find something. Link to original plays from
[Playspedia](https://playspedia.com/) can be found after
every animation.

## Pure CSS

This project has been made with only HTML and CSS.
